# QUARCC Website Requirements

## Overview of QUARCC
QUARCC is a student-run club at the University of Concordia in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Our club is dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to learn about and engage with the field of quantitative finanace. We host a variety of events throughout the year, including lectures, workshops, and social gatherings. Our club is open to all students, regardless of their background or experience in the field. We also have two internal groups (QUARCC Research Group and Stock Market Analysts (SMA)). SMA is a guided cirriculum where members learn about facets of systematic trading, statistics, and machine learning. QUARCC Research Group is a more advanced group where members are divided into 3 teams, research, development, and trading. They improve and manager several paper portfolios that trade live on the market in an attempt to mimic the structure of a quantitative trading firm. QUARCC stands for Quantitative Research and Competitions Club.

### What does QUARCC Offer to Students?

Other than what is mentioned in the general overview, QUARCC offers students a networkd of like-minded individuals who share a passion for quantitative finance. We also offer students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the field through our research group, SMA, and the paper fund. Our academic series includes guest lectures from industry professionals/executives and faculty members. Workshops and materials are also provided to members to help them learn about the field of quantitative finance.

## Website Requirements

### Website Functionality
- The website should be responsive and mobile-friendly. (Ask me if this is challenging with the design, I understand that terminals are hard to emulate on mobile)
- The website should have a search function to find events and members.
- The website should have the following pages:
    - Home
    - About
    - Events
    - Teams (the following two subdivisions of members):
        - Executives
        - SMA/QRG
    - Join (this will also have our contact information)
    - Paper Fund (for the paper portfolios of the QUARCC Research Group)
    - 

### Website Design
- Layout Structure:

    - Left Column: Create a large ASCII-style 'Q' logo in the same blocky, geometric style as the logo in the image.

    - Right Column: Three distinct bordered 'System' boxes: 'Club Details', 'Pages', and 'Contact'. The pages should be clickable in case people do not want to use the CLI. 

- Styling:

    - Global Font: Use JetBrains Mono for all text.

    - Colors: Use a deep dark-mode background. Replace all instances of the 'Omarchy green' with a darker vibrant purple.

    - Borders: Use the same thin, ASCII-style lines and labels (e.g., ──Hardware──) to enclose sections.
    
    - Ensure the JetBrains Mono font is imported via Google Fonts at the start. All 'links' in the boxes or CLI should have a subtle underline hover effect in the #8B2FC9 purple.

- Interactive CLI: At the bottom of the page, add a functional input line: [user@quarcc ~]$ . If the user types help, display a list of site links.

- Execution: Initialize the project and show the preview in the built-in browser."- The website should roughly use the style of the image provided called fastfetch.png.
