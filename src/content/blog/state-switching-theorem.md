# A Scientific Framework for Probabilistic State-Switching Detection in Individual Equities

## Abstract

Detecting regime changes in financial time series is a central problem in quantitative finance because return dynamics, volatility clustering, and risk premia are not stable over time. This article presents a scientific framework for identifying state switches at the individual-stock level using a three-state endogenous regime-switching model with time-varying transition probabilities, duration dependence, and heteroskedastic state-conditional emissions.

The framework models each stock as evolving through latent low-, medium-, and high-volatility regimes, where regime persistence and switching intensity are functions of observable market and stock-specific signals. Transition dynamics are made non-homogeneous through a softmax parameterization driven by contemporaneous covariates, while duration dependence is introduced through a negative-binomial hazard that separates persistence from conditional switching. Observed returns are modeled through state-specific skewed-$t$ distributions with GJR-GARCH-type conditional variance dynamics augmented by volume information.

Bayesian filtering yields daily posterior regime probabilities, which are then projected forward to estimate directional transition odds over a chosen horizon. A tradable signal is constructed by comparing the forward odds of transitioning into low-volatility versus high-volatility regimes, scaling by switch intensity and a market-stress amplifier, and combining the result with a slower-moving weekly “switchability” overlay. The framework unifies latent-state inference, state-dependent volatility modeling, duration-aware transition structure, and cross-sectional ranking into a coherent probabilistic architecture for regime-switch detection.

## 1. Introduction

Financial assets do not evolve under a single stationary law. Periods of calm trading, transitional uncertainty, and crisis-like turbulence often exhibit distinct dynamics in return variance, tail thickness, autocorrelation, and response to information. Traditional linear models, and even many static volatility models, fail to capture this structural instability because they implicitly assume that parameters remain fixed across time. In practice, however, the market appears to move across latent regimes, and the transition between regimes is itself state dependent, path dependent, and influenced by observable market conditions.

A scientifically grounded approach to this problem is to model the data-generating process as a latent regime-switching system. In such a system, returns are generated conditionally on an unobserved state, while the state evolves according to a stochastic transition mechanism. The innovation in the present framework lies in making the transition dynamics endogenous and non-homogeneous: rather than assuming fixed transition probabilities, the framework allows switching behavior to respond to stock-specific and market-wide variables. Moreover, the persistence of a regime is not treated as memoryless. Instead, the probability of remaining in, or exiting from, a regime depends on the elapsed duration of the current spell.

The objective of the framework is not merely to classify historical regimes. Its goal is operational: to detect stocks whose current latent-state configuration implies a high probability of imminent transition, and to rank such names cross-sectionally for potential trading decisions. This transforms regime-switching inference from a purely descriptive econometric exercise into a forward-looking signal generation problem.

## 2. Conceptual Structure of the Framework

The framework is built around five layers:

1. **Latent state representation**: each stock is assumed to occupy one of three unobserved regimes at every date.
2. **Time-varying transition mechanism**: transition probabilities evolve as functions of observable predictors.
3. **Duration dependence**: regime exit probabilities depend on the time already spent in the current state.
4. **State-conditional return emissions**: returns are drawn from heavy-tailed, asymmetric distributions with state-specific volatility dynamics.
5. **Forward transition scoring**: posterior state probabilities are propagated through the model to generate a directional switch signal.

These layers are linked through recursive Bayesian filtering. At each date, the model forms a prior belief over regimes from the previous day’s posterior, updates that prior using the transition mechanism and duration effect, and then incorporates the new return observation via the emission likelihood. The resulting posterior is the model’s best estimate of the stock’s current latent regime distribution.

## 3. Latent State Representation

For each stock $i$ and date $t$, let the latent state be

$$
s_{i,t} \in \{0,1,2\},
$$

where the states are ordered by unconditional variance:

- $0$: low-volatility regime
- $1$: intermediate-volatility regime
- $2$: high-volatility regime

Rather than assigning a hard label, the model maintains a filtered probability vector

$$
\pi_{i,t}
=
\big[
P(s_{i,t}=0 \mid \mathcal{F}_t),
P(s_{i,t}=1 \mid \mathcal{F}_t),
P(s_{i,t}=2 \mid \mathcal{F}_t)
\big],
$$

where $\mathcal{F}_t$ denotes the information set available at date $t$. This probabilistic representation is essential because state transitions are rarely instantaneous in an inferential sense; during turbulent periods, the model may assign meaningful mass to multiple regimes simultaneously.

---

## 4. Non-Homogeneous Transition Matrix

In classical hidden Markov models, the transition matrix is fixed. That assumption is too restrictive for financial applications, where switching intensity is clearly influenced by contemporaneous signals such as order imbalance, realized volatility, market stress, and liquidity conditions.

To address this, the framework defines the raw transition probabilities through a row-wise softmax parameterization. Let

$$
x_t = [NOI_t,\; V_{ratio,t},\; \sigma_{GK,t},\; f_t,\; FCIX_t]
$$

be the vector of observable covariates, where these features summarize market pressure, volume dynamics, realized volatility, latent factors, and financial-conditions stress. For each origin state $i$ and destination state $j$, define the linear predictor

$$
\eta_{ij,t} = \alpha_{ij} + \beta_{ij}^{\top} x_t.
$$

The time-varying transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$ is then

$$
T_{ij,t}
=
\frac{\exp(\eta_{ij,t})}
{\sum_{m=0}^{2}\exp(\eta_{im,t})}.
$$

This yields a valid $3 \times 3$ transition matrix $T_t$, with each row summing to one. Because $x_t$ varies over time, the matrix is non-homogeneous. This gives the model the ability to respond dynamically to evolving market conditions.

Scientifically, this construction has several advantages. First, it imposes the correct probabilistic constraints without requiring ad hoc normalization. Second, it allows different covariates to influence different transition channels asymmetrically. Third, it permits direct economic interpretation: for example, higher realized volatility may increase the probability of transitioning from the medium-volatility state into the high-volatility state, while improved financial conditions may favor transitions toward the low-volatility state.

---

## 5. Duration Dependence and Hazard Mixing

A standard Markov chain is memoryless: the probability of leaving a state depends only on the current state and not on how long the process has already remained there. Empirically, this is often unrealistic. Financial regimes can become more fragile or more entrenched as time passes. For example, an extended high-volatility spell may eventually exhaust itself, while a newly entered crisis regime may initially be highly persistent.

To incorporate this feature, the framework introduces a duration variable $d_t$, representing the elapsed spell length in the current regime, and a state-specific hazard function $h_k(d_t)$. This hazard is modeled using a negative-binomial-inspired specification, allowing flexible duration shapes.

The prior regime distribution before observing the new return is constructed as

$$
\tilde{\pi}_t
=
(1-h_t)\odot \pi_{t-1}
+
h_t \odot \left(T_t^{eff\top}\pi_{t-1}\right),
$$

where $\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication and $T_t^{eff}$ is an effective transition matrix. The intuition is clear:

- with probability $1-h_k(d_t)$, the system stays in its current state
- with probability $h_k(d_t)$, it switches according to the transition structure encoded in $T_t^{eff}$

This decomposition is important. It separates the question _“does the regime end?”_ from the question _“if it ends, where does it go?”_ The first is governed by duration dependence, while the second is governed by observable-state transition scores. This makes the switching process richer than a standard HMM and better aligned with the persistence properties seen in empirical asset dynamics.

---

## 6. State-Conditional Emission Model

The latent-state process alone is not observable; inference requires a likelihood for the observed returns conditional on each state. In the framework, returns are modeled using state-specific skewed-$t$ emission densities. This choice is motivated by the well-known non-Gaussian features of financial returns: excess kurtosis, asymmetry, and occasional large shocks.

For stock $i$, conditional on state $k$, the return $r_{i,t}$ has log-likelihood contribution

$$
\ell_{i,t}^{(k)} = \log p(r_{i,t} \mid s_{i,t}=k, \Theta_k),
$$

where $\Theta_k$ includes the location, tail, skewness, and volatility parameters for regime $k$.

Conditional variance is further modeled through a state-specific GJR-GARCH process, optionally augmented with volume information:

$$
h_{k,t}
=
\omega_k
+
\alpha_k \epsilon_{t-1}^2
+
\gamma_k \mathbf{1}_{\{\epsilon_{t-1}<0\}}\epsilon_{t-1}^2
+
\beta_k h_{k,t-1}
+
\delta_k \cdot \text{VolumeTerm}_{t-1}.
$$

This allows each regime to exhibit its own volatility response pattern. In particular, the high-volatility state may have stronger leverage effects, higher persistence, or greater sensitivity to abnormal trading activity than the low-volatility state.

The emission model is critical for state identification. A transition matrix can shape prior beliefs, but it is the return likelihood that determines whether the observed data are more consistent with calm, transitional, or stressed regimes.

---

## 7. Bayesian Filtering and Posterior Updating

At each date, the model recursively updates regime probabilities in two steps.

### 7.1 Prediction step

The previous posterior $\pi_{t-1}$ is propagated forward through the duration-adjusted transition mechanism to obtain the prior $\tilde{\pi}_t$.

### 7.2 Update step

The new return observation is incorporated using Bayes’ rule:

$$
\pi_t
\propto
\tilde{\pi}_t \odot \exp(\ell_t),
$$

where

$$
\ell_t = [\ell_t^{(0)}, \ell_t^{(1)}, \ell_t^{(2)}].
$$

After normalization so the components sum to one, $\pi_t$ becomes the filtered posterior regime distribution.

This recursive filter is the core state-switch detection engine. The model does not wait for a full regime change to occur in a binary sense. Instead, it continuously tracks whether probability mass is migrating from one regime toward another. That migration itself is the signature of an emerging state switch.

---

## 8. Detecting State Switches Through Forward Regime Odds

The framework does not treat the posterior probability of the current state as the final signal. Instead, it asks a more forward-looking question: given the current posterior and transition structure, what are the odds that the stock moves into the low-volatility regime versus the high-volatility regime over a horizon $h$?

Let $\pi_{t+h}$ denote the horizon-$h$ forecast regime distribution obtained by iterating the transition system forward. The model defines directional transition quantities such as

$$
q_{low}
=
\pi_{t+h,0}\big(1-\pi_{t,0}\big),
\qquad
q_{high}
=
\pi_{t+h,2}\big(1-\pi_{t,2}\big).
$$

These quantities are not merely future regime probabilities. They discount names already heavily embedded in the destination state. As a result, the signal focuses on **movement toward** a state rather than static occupancy of that state.

The directional switch score is then based on the log-odds ratio

$$
\log\left(\frac{q_{low}}{q_{high}}\right).
$$

A positive value suggests higher odds of moving toward a low-volatility regime than toward a high-volatility regime, while a negative value suggests the opposite. Confidence adjustments can be added to penalize diffuse forecasts and reward sharper probability separation.

This is a sophisticated and economically meaningful detection criterion. It captures not only whether a regime is likely, but whether the stock is in the process of **transitioning into** that regime from somewhere else.

---

## 9. Switch Intensity and Market-Stress Amplification

Because not all forecast differences are equally actionable, the raw directional score is scaled by additional modifiers.

First, the framework includes a switch-intensity proxy,

$$
p^{switch} = 1 - \pi_{t+h,\mathrm{dom}},
$$

where $\mathrm{dom}$ denotes the dominant projected regime. If one regime overwhelmingly dominates the forecast, there may be little ambiguity but also little switching activity left to monetize. By contrast, a lower dominant-state concentration implies more meaningful transition dynamics.

Second, the model applies a market-stress amplifier based on financial conditions:

$$
1 + \lambda_{fcix}\tanh(FCIX_t).
$$

This allows the same stock-level regime configuration to be interpreted differently depending on the broader stress environment. In practice, transitions during high market stress may be more informative, more abrupt, or more consequential than analogous transitions during benign periods.

Putting these pieces together yields a tradable daily score $S^{trade}$, which can be interpreted as a directionally signed, confidence-adjusted, switch-aware ranking statistic.

---

## 10. Weekly Overlay for Cross-Sectional Switchability

Daily latent-state inference can be noisy, especially when evaluated across a broad equity universe. To improve stability, the framework introduces a slower-moving weekly overlay.

The first step is a weekly gating mechanism that restricts attention to the most “switchable” names, such as the top 50 stocks ranked by a realized path-instability measure, for example

$$
\sum (\log(H/L))^2.
$$

This metric favors stocks whose recent intraperiod variability suggests meaningful latent-state dynamics rather than near-static behavior.

Next, a lagged weekly ridge model produces a “switch potential” score $W^{lag}$, which is standardized to $Z(W^{lag})$. This weekly component is blended with the daily regime-based score:

$$
S^{final}
=
(1-\omega)S^{trade} + \omega Z(W^{lag}),
\qquad \omega \approx 0.20.
$$

This blend reflects a bias-variance tradeoff. The daily score is adaptive and responsive, while the weekly overlay is smoother and more robust. Their combination reduces false positives while preserving sensitivity to genuine switching episodes.

## 11. Scientific Interpretation of State-Switch Detection

Within this framework, a state switch is not defined as a discrete timestamp at which the regime label flips with certainty. Rather, it is defined probabilistically as a sustained and directionally meaningful migration of posterior and forward probability mass away from the current regime and toward an alternative regime.

This is a more defensible scientific definition for financial data, where latent states are not directly observable and the boundary between regimes is often fuzzy. The model detects switching through four simultaneous signals:

1. **Posterior erosion of the current dominant state**
2. **Increase in forward probability of an alternative state**
3. **Elevated duration-adjusted hazard of leaving the current regime**
4. **Cross-sectional confirmation through switchability overlays**

Hence, a switch is better understood as an inferred transition process rather than a binary event.

## 12. Strengths of the Framework

This architecture has several scientific strengths.

### 12.1 It respects stylized facts of financial returns

Heavy tails, skewness, volatility clustering, and leverage effects are explicitly incorporated through skewed-$t$ emissions and GJR-GARCH dynamics.

### 12.2 It avoids unrealistic constant transitions

The transition matrix responds to economically meaningful covariates, allowing regime changes to become more or less likely depending on prevailing conditions.

### 12.3 It introduces temporal memory

Duration dependence overcomes the memoryless limitation of classical Markov chains.

### 12.4 It produces actionable forecasts

The signal is based on forward regime migration rather than static classification, making it more suitable for trading or ranking applications.

### 12.5 It supports cross-sectional deployment

Because the output is a normalized score, the framework naturally extends to a universe of stocks and can be used for ranking, gating, and portfolio construction.

## 13. Limitations and Methodological Risks

Despite its sophistication, the framework carries important limitations.

First, three states may be too restrictive for some equities. A three-state model is a useful compromise between interpretability and tractability, but it may compress distinct dynamics into overly broad bins.

Second, the model can be parameter-heavy. State-specific emission parameters, transition coefficients, and duration terms create significant estimation complexity, especially when fitted stock by stock. Without careful regularization, shrinkage, or partial pooling, overfitting becomes a serious risk.

Third, latent-state labels are identified only up to interpretation. Ordering states by unconditional variance helps, but transitional ambiguity remains, particularly between the middle and high-volatility states.

Fourth, regime forecasts can be sensitive to feature engineering. If predictors such as $NOI$, $V_{ratio}$, or $FCIX$ are unstable, revised, poorly normalized, or correlated in problematic ways, the transition matrix may become noisy.

Fifth, the framework detects probabilistic switching, not causal structural breaks. A rising switch probability means the latent-state model sees mounting evidence of transition; it does not prove that an economically fundamental regime shift has occurred.

## 14. Extensions and Research Directions

Several extensions could improve the framework further.

A first extension is to move from a fixed three-state structure to a hierarchical or semi-parametric model where the number of effective states can vary across stocks while preserving a common macro-state backbone.

A second extension is to introduce cross-sectional dependence explicitly. At present, the model is per-stock, with market-wide inputs entering as exogenous features. A richer alternative would allow a shared latent market regime to interact with stock-specific idiosyncratic regimes.

A third extension is to replace purely linear transition predictors with nonlinear gating networks, provided regularization remains strong enough to preserve interpretability and out-of-sample discipline.

A fourth extension is to incorporate macroeconomic or options-implied variables into the hazard itself, not only into the transition matrix, so that regime duration becomes jointly driven by elapsed time and external stress indicators.

Finally, forward regime probabilities could be tied directly to expected holding-period optimization. Instead of merely ranking switch likelihoods, one could estimate state-conditional expected return, expected variance, and expected dwell time to derive horizon-specific entry and exit rules.

---

## 15. Conclusion

This framework provides a scientifically coherent method for detecting state switches in individual equities by combining latent-state filtering, time-varying transition matrices, duration dependence, and state-specific heavy-tailed volatility modeling. Its central insight is that regime changes should be treated as probabilistic, dynamically conditioned processes rather than binary events inferred from static thresholds.

By tracking daily posterior regime probabilities and projecting them forward through an endogenous transition mechanism, the model identifies stocks whose latent dynamics imply meaningful movement toward calmer or more stressed volatility regimes. From a research standpoint, the framework is attractive because it integrates econometric rigor with practical signal design. From a trading standpoint, it is appealing because it ranks names by the likelihood and direction of regime migration, rather than simply labeling current conditions.

The result is a robust state-switch detection architecture that is both interpretable and operationally useful.
